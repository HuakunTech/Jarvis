# @jarvis/api-ui

This package is an API package for UI extension commands.

Helper functions for interacting with the operating system and Jarvis app itself are provided.

Many API functions are simply reexport of Tauri's APIs and plugin APIs.

However this package will still explicitly list all export one by one as not all APIs are permitted to be used in the UI extension.
