If a permission requires access to system APIs such as clipboard, file system, etc.,
the extension must declare the permission in the `package.json` file.

## Clipboard

- `clipboard-read`
- `clipboard-write`

## File System

- `file-read-all`
- `file-write-all`
- `file-read-home`
- `file-write-home`
- `file-read-default`
- `file-write-default`
