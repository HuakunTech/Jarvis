title: Extension Manifest Validator
description: Jarvis Extension Manifest Validator
---

Jarvis extensions metadata is defined in `package.json` for simplicity.

In order to facilitate the validation of the extension manifest, I provide some tools that can be used to validate the manifest file.

## Json Schema

In the `package.json` of your extension, you can add a `$schema` field. In VSCode,
this will enable intellisense for the fields in the manifest file.
Missing fields and wrong data types will be highlighted.

```json title="package.json"
{
    "$schema": "https://jarvis-extensions.huakun.tech/jarvis-ext-package-json-schema.json",
    ...
}
```

If you don't want to include this in your `package.json`, you can also configure VSCode workspace setting

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["<path to extension>/package.json"],
      "url": "https://jarvis-extensions.huakun.tech/jarvis-ext-package-json-schema.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Playground

Here are two playgrounds with schema enabled. You can validate your extension manifest.

### Sample Package JSON

Try removing the `description` field or change `jarvis` to `jarvis2`. Error messages will be shown below.

import ManifestValidator from "../../../components/ManifestValidator.tsx";

<div className="not-content">
<ManifestValidator client:only="react" />
</div>
