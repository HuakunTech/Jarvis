## Design

Project Manager config file is located at

- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/alefragnani.project-manager/projects.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\alefragnani.project-manager\projects.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/alefragnani.project-manager/projects.json`

Simply load the file, parse it and list all projects in a list.
